1. Navigate to the project directory.
cd FoodTruckApp

2. Compile the Java files.
javac com/skilldistillery/foodtruck/app/*.java 
com/skilldistillery/foodtruck/entities/*.java

3. Run the application
java com.skilldistillery.foodtruck.app.FoodTruckApp

4. Follow the prompts to input food truck information and interact with the menu options.

# Description
This is a simple Java console application that allows users to input and rate food trucks. Users can input information such as the food truck's name, food type, and a numeric rating. After input, users can choose to list all food trucks, see the average rating, display the highest-rated food truck, or quit the program.

# Tech Used
Java
Git

# Lessons Learned
1. Building a console application mostly from scratch in Java.
2. Handling user input and implementing a menu system in conjunction with a separate FoodTruck class
3. Working with arrays and object-oriented programming concepts in Java.
4. Using Eclipse to generate ctors, getters, setters, and a toString() method. 
5. My biggest learned lesson from this assignment would be putting everything together that we've learned so far. From using a couple while loops, if statements, and even a switch to the newer concepts of OOP and working with arrays.
